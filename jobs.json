Anything and everything Infoplus software will be your focus. This ranges from possible escalated tickets about APIs, SQL backend, EDI questions, and any other customer tickets that are escalated from Tier 1 and Tier 2 support queues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Troubleshooting and Solving Technical Issues\n<ul>\n<li>Your role will help solve the most challenging and in-depth customer tickets (what we call Tier 3). These are customer issues that go deeper than the surface in our software and require technical expertise such as JavaScript, APIs, etc. Anything short of a bug fix falls under this role.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Recreating Warehouse Scenarios and Problems\n<ul>\n<li>You‚Äôll be reproducing and recreating the warehousing problems and scenarios customers face within our software. This includes tickets about: the application itself, the features, scenarios within a warehouse and their related processes, or third party softwares that are tied to Infoplus.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Serving as the Knowledge Resource for Better Documentation\n<ul>\n<li>You will be the technical and Infoplus expert-level knowledge resource to help the rest of your support and content team enhance and create internal and external documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Customer Communication\n<ul>\n<li>This is a semi-customer facing role where your responses are requested. You‚Äôll be comfortable answering customer tickets on a regular basis and providing updates along the way of your solution to exceed their expectations. When you aren‚Äôt doing this directly, you‚Äôre providing another support agent with the same information and details for them to communicate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What a Top Candidate Will Have</strong></p>\n<p>We‚Äôre interested in the Right Person (yes, it‚Äôs meant to be capitalized) - for us, a Right Person is someone who matches our Core Values, has the right skills and experience, and this job would fill their cup and get them excited each morning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knack for Making the Complex, Simple\n<ul>\n<li>You want to take the complex and make it simple (and are the best in your field at it). Your communication and solutions are focused on the greater good for everyone involved. You know you are the expert, and you want to share that knowing it will bring a solution to a new, and better, level.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Strong Independent Worker\n<ul>\n<li>You want to find answers to your own questions. You are someone that has an internal fire to continuously learn the application without being guided or told what to look for. You want to be the expert, and nothing will stop you from becoming that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Technical Zone of Genius\n<ul>\n<li>You get energy from working in the depths of software. You lose time finding, diagnosing, and solving technical problems. Your passion is supporting great software at the most technical level and beyond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Focused on Customers Success\n<ul>\n<li>You only accept finding the win-for-all path forward. You choose to look through the lens of the customer first. You make choices with the customer‚Äôs long-term goals and relationship in mind (sometimes this is the ‚Äúhard no‚Äù).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ability to Dig In and Discern\n<ul>\n<li>You want to roll up your sleeves and get down and dirty in the nuances of everything Infoplus. There can be a lot of noise and muck, so you know how to tell what‚Äôs important. You also recognize when to come up for air on a problem and can prioritize your workload and customer tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://vonq.io/3sxjJZg\">Click here for the application form!</a></p>\n",

Recognizing that customer experience is pivotal to the success of a product or service is also a requirement for this job.

Good fit if you like moving fast, having impact, and working on a variety of different things.</p>\n<h2>Who we are</h2>\n<p>We‚Äôre a fast-moving startup with a vision to empower all professionals by helping them build better relationships. Our vision is to fix the network gap: the inequality of opportunity driven by not having the right connections. To solve this problem, we‚Äôre combining the best practices of the world‚Äôs top relationship builders with artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre building a mission-driven team that strives to live out our values every day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer-centricity</li>\n<li>Diversity of perspective</li>\n<li>Authenticity</li>\n<li>Growth (individual and collective)</li>\n<li>Impact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We‚Äôre an ambitious, driven team and we push ourselves to accomplish a lot quickly. In the past couple of years we've gone through one of the world's top accelerators, raised two rounds of venture financing, launched our product, rapidly grown our customer base, and architected a robust set of machine learning models as a core source of competitive advantage. In the process, we‚Äôve been named one of Chicago‚Äôs top 50 startups to watch, one of Chicago Inno‚Äôs 50 on Fire, a part of the highly selective Google for Startups Black Founders Accelerator and Black Founders Fund. And we‚Äôre just getting started!</p>\n<h2>The opportunity</h2>\n<p>4Degrees is at an inflection point - we‚Äôve built a product that‚Äôs pioneering a new category of software (relationship intelligence), and are rapidly growing.  We're well funded, have hundreds of highly engaged customers, who consistently increase their contract size with us, and are planning with us on how we can take this company into the future.  We‚Äôve done this with a scrappy, early-stage team.</p>\n<p>The opportunity ahead of us is vast - every business that relies on their relationship network to drive their business has a use case for 4Degrees.  To seize that opportunity, we're looking for great engineers to help us build on top of the foundation we've created, while also pioneering new ways to help our customers unlock the value their relationships can bring to their business.  You‚Äôll build and use a versatile set of skills: switching between tasks like rolling out major new functionality, diagnosing and fixing bugs, and playing support for other front-end or back-end engineers.</p>\n<p>By joining us, you will play a highly impactful role in re-inventing the way professional relationships are managed and building a rapidly growing category. Along the way, you‚Äôll have an opportunity to get unrivaled exposure to all facets of building a startup, and directly shape the outcomes of 4Degrees and its customers.  And if you want to build a company of your own after joining us, you'll get direct mentorship from the founding team and support in doing so!</p>\n<h2>The impact you‚Äôll make by joining us</h2>\n<h3>Within 1 month you‚Äôll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete our onboarding process - which will help you ramp up on our company, vision, product, key objectives, and how your role will contribute to all of those!</li>\n<li>Dive deep into our product development process and understand how we go from concept to design to implementation</li>\n<li>Learn our technical stack and apply development patterns throughout your work</li>\n<li>Ship your first small feature to our customers</li>\n<li>Join our customer outreach program - including sitting in on your first set of live conversations with existing customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Within 3 months you‚Äôll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume ownership of a quarterly roadmap project, which will enable you to drive the development of a key piece of functionality for our customers</li>\n<li>Drive timely resolution of customer issues, in coordination with the customer success and implementation teams.</li>\n<li>Have made a visible impact on the product for all 4Degrees users</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Within 6 months you‚Äôll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reliably ship full features to our customers and for internal team use</li>\n<li>Understand the product at scale and be able to provide input to improve our technical systems and tools</li>\n<li>Be comfortable navigating most of our stack and infrastructure</li>\n<li>Participate in interviewing and hiring, as a way to influence team growth and how our values inform our culture</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Within 1-2 years, you‚Äôll:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Be responsible for the planning, scoping, design, and implementation of new features</li>\n<li>Champion future engineering initiatives</li>\n<li>Help build and shape the future of engineering at 4Degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About you</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Excited about the 4Degrees mission and believes in our core values</li>\n<li>Thrives in a fast-paced environment, and is comfortable with experimentation and risk-taking</li>\n<li>Driven by the opportunity to create impact, and takes full ownership of achieving personal and team objectives</li>\n<li>Motivated to explore the potential for technology to augment people‚Äôs ability to form and strengthen professional relationships</li>\n<li>Challenges existing industry best practices and takes inspiration from disparate sources to build a groundbreaking product</li>\n<li>Collaborative mindset - recognizing that most great outcomes are accomplished by teams, not individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Skills you‚Äôll need</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Proficiency with back-end programming (Python preferred, but we can train you if you're good with Ruby, Node, PHP, etc.)</li>\n<li>Proficiency with front-end programming in vanilla languages (Javascript, HTML, CSS)</li>\n<li>Comfort with plain SQL and an ORM</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>We‚Äôd be really excited if you are</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Experienced with mobile development, particularly using React Native</li>\n<li>Experienced with the Flask web framework</li>\n<li>Experienced with machine learning and/or statistical analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitive cash+equity compensation based on level of capability</li>\n<li>Unlimited PTO (min. 2 weeks, avg. 3-4)</li>\n<li>Unlimited paid sick leave (mandatory for infectious diseases)</li>\n<li>Employer group health insurance, subsidized 75% by company</li>\n<li>Annual professional development stipend</li>\n<li>Commuter benefits</li>\n</ul>\n",
